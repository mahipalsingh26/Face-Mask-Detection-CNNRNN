# Face-Mask-Detection-CNNRNN
This repository demonstrating CNN-RNN code implementation for face mask detetcion on realtime video stream. Model is able to detect mask even if person is wearing cap or glasses.

## Getting Started
Below steps will get you a copy of this reposistory up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.




### Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/mahipalsingh26/Face-Mask-Detection-CNNRNN.git
```

### Dataset
I used [This](https://www.kaggle.com/aneerbanchakraborty/face-mask-detection-data) dataset for training and testing.
