# Face-Mask-Detection-CNNRNN
This repository demonstrating CNN-RNN code implementation for face mask detetcion on realtime video stream. Model is able to detect mask even if person is wearing cap or glasses.

## Getting Started
Below steps will get you a copy of this reposistory up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Demo
